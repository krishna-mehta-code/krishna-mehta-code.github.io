    <h2>Introduction to Programs & Programming Languages</h2>

    <h3>💻 What is a Computer Program?</h3>
    <p>
      Computers are fast, but they only understand limited low-level instructions.<br>
        A <strong>computer program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer exactly what to do,
        step-by-step. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Programs are written in a <strong>programming language</strong>, which lets humans create instructions
        computers can follow.
        <br>The act of writing programs = <strong>programming</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>▶️ Running a Program</h3>
    <p>When a computer performs the instructions inside a program, it is <strong>running/executing</strong> it.</p>

    <p>A program will not start unless someone:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>launches / runs / executes it</li>
        <li>or another program launches it</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🖥 Hardware — Where Programs Actually Run</h3>
    <p>Hardware = all physical parts of a computer.</p>

    <p>Important hardware components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Known as the <em>brain</em></li>
                <li>Executes instructions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Memory (RAM)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Where programs are loaded before & during execution</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Interactive Devices</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitor, touchscreen, keyboard, mouse</li>
                <li>Let the user interact with the computer</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Storage Devices</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Hard drive, SSD, flash memory</li>
                <li>Store data even when the computer is off</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧠 Software</h3>
    <p>Software = Software are basically programs designed to run on hardware.</p>
<hr>
    <h3>💻 Platform</h3>
    <p>
        Modern programs interact not just with hardware but also with other <strong>software</strong> such as
        the operating system (OS).
    </p>

    <p>A <strong>platform</strong> = combination of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hardware</li>
        <li>Software (OS, browser, etc.) — provides an environment for programs to run</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Example:</em> “PC” = Windows OS + x86 CPU platform.</p>

    <h3>🛠 Platform Services</h3>
    <p>Platforms provide useful functions, like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Giving memory</li>
        <li>Letting apps create files</li>
        <li>Playing sounds</li>
        <li>Using system capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        If a program depends too much on a specific platform, it won’t run on others unless modified.
    </p>

    <h3>🚚 Portability & Porting</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            A <strong>portable</strong> program can easily run on multiple platforms.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Porting</strong> = modifying a program so it works on a different platform.
        </li>
    </ul>
